Data Source:
============

The data source we plan to use on this project is university 
provided record's of the students' scores and/or grades in 
various computer science courses (including courses on data 
structures, algorithms, database management systems, etc.) 
along with course material for each course, which will be 
extracted from NPTEL's online video course transcripts, 
the university's course information records, and from the 
appendix and index of reference textbooks. We also plan on 
extending our system to process information from various other 
sources such as professor ratings, student course difficulty 
ratings, etc. 

The data on students' grades/scores will not be compared 
against each other in our project, but will be used to assess 
the 'history' of each student, to determine the predicted 
performance of the student in a particular course. The course 
materials will be used to determine the level of dependency the 
course may have on it's prerequisites. Other data sources such 
as professor ratings will be used to determine the difficulty 
level the student may expect in a course as taught by the 
professor.
