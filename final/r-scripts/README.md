# A neural network and linear model approach towards performance prediction of secondary school students

Analysis done on [UCI Exam Performance Dataset.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

**How to run the R Script predictPerformance.R**

- In the setwd() section of the code enter the path to the UCI Exam Performance Dataset(Either Math or Portoguese) present in the local machine.
- The result obtained for the neural network section of the code is highly influenced by the number of layers and number of neurons in each layer. Read the documentation about the [neuralnet package in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neuralnet/neuralnet.pdf) to experiment with the design of the neural network.
- The K Means section of the code was not used for this project but the code is present as reference for future use if needed.
