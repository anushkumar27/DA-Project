Introduction:
=============

One of the areas of difficulty for course advisors and professors lies in making 
appropriate decisions for course selections for their students, a problem that is 
also a point of contention for students themselves.

This system we have attempted to build takes into account, for each student, their 
previous performance in courses, and make a prediction for the performance of a 
in a selected course. This analysis not only takes into account the previous grades 
obtained by a student in a course, but also takes into account the level of 
dependency between the prequisite courses and the selected course. Thus, it attempts 
to improve the prediction of a simple, naive linear model by associating each 
prerequisite of a course with weights that are proportional to the level of dependency 
between them, thereby affecting the predicted grades of the student more than the 
performance of the student in other courses.

Currently, due to unavailability of data, we have just made do with the UCI Student 
Performance dataset that was available. The prediction takes into account various 
other factors such as alcohol consumption, family life quality, free time after school, 
etc.

Why is our solution important and useful:
=========================================

As students, one of the areas of difficulty we face is selection of electives. Not only do we 
take into account the nature of the course and our level of interest in them, but we must also
worry about whether we will be able to perform satisfactorially in them. One of the ways we do 
this is by taking into account the prerequisites of the course and 'guesstimating' the level of 
dependency between the course and its prerequisites, and looking at our previous experience with 
those courses, we determine whether it is feasible to actually take the course.

Our model attempts to formalise the situation and make it more accurate. It actually goes and 
determines the fraction of dependencies and looks at our grades in those subjects, and makes 
a prediction as to our projected grades had we taken it.

One of our main objectives is also to help in the process of counselling, and making sure the 
potential of every student is realised to the extent that is possible. This systems merely adds 
another tool to their repository. The final decision must be taken by them.
