Future Improvements:
====================

So far we have managed to implement a relatively simpler system wherein
the input is a single sentence document and analyses the document, giving
the desired output.

In the future, we will work to make the system 'better' than its current 
state, by scaling the system to handle larger documents, and be able to 
understand complex geometric relations that are expressed in a natural 
language that is commonly used in such documents. The system should be able
to handle more abstract concepts than what it is currently trained for.

We hope to achieve this using some of IBM Watson's APIs for some the components
of this system. Currently, we have been unable to use Watson due to lack of
resources, but we can improve the usability of the system drastically using IBM
Watson. We also hope to expand the technologies and algorithms being used to
incorporate more accurate and sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

Possible Future technologies and approaches:
1. Neural Networks to understand complex and high level geometric relations
   found in documents
2. IBM Watson Alchemy Language API to offload processing of some the NLP currently 
   being done on a local server
3. IBM Watson Conversation to provide fluid, natural interface for user to interact 
   with system.
4. Moving completely to either OpenNLP or NLTK for local NLP services, or if possible
   to IBM Watson cloud services
