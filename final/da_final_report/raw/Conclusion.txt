Conclusion:
===========

In conclusion, in the approach taken by Cortez et. al., non-linear 
models such as neural nets were outperformed by tree based models, 
though in our project, our approach with neural nets and using a 
linear model gave better results than using a neural net. In 
addition, our neural net and linear model outperformed the random 
forest approach taken by Cortez et. al. when predicting the grades 
of the student. 
Later, we hope to tailor the system for our University, taking into 
account the results of text analysis on the course material of the 
courses to determine the fraction of dependencies on its prerequisites, 
and tailor the performance prediction even more for each course, 
rather than using just the student's data to make predictions.
