Initial Analysis:
=================

So far, we have done some initial analysis on the course material 
for various courses, including a course on computer networks, data 
structures & algorithms, programming languages.

The first step we took was identifying viable sources of course 
material, where in we could get enough text and material that 
decribes the content and possibly indicates the dependencies of 
the course. So far, we have decided on using NPTEL online video 
computer science course transcripts to as they are actual transcripts 
of lectures taught to students, and as such should have all the 
content relevant to the course, and will reveal the extent to which 
a course is dependent on it's prerequisites.

As an initial first step in analysing the course material, we have 
generated word clouds to gain an idea of the types of common words 
(are the words related to a prerequisite or are they unique to the 
course), and the frequencies. From these word clouds, we can see 
that the words unique to the course, in the courses we have analysed, 
seem to dominate the words related to any of their prerequisites. In 
this case, this seems to imply that the dependency levels seems to be 
low, compared to the entire content of the course material.
